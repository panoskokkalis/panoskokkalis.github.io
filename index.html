I was born in 1981, in Greece. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in <a href="http://www.semfe.ntua.gr/en/" target="_blank">School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences</a> (field of optoelectronics and laser) from the 
<a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/" target="_blank">National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)</a>, Greece in 2007 and 2009 respectively. I defended my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Physics/Remote Sensing, NTUA, in 2014. 
As an undergraduate and graduate research assistant I worked in the field of ground based and space borne active and passive remote sensing techniques. 
My Ph.D. thesis was mainly focused on the upgrade/optimization of NTUA<a>&apos;</a>s Raman lidar, as well as on the atmospheric aerosol characterization 
(optical and microphysical properties) through the synergy of Raman/depolarization lidar and sunphotometric measurements. 
During the implementation of my Ph.D., I worked for 3 months (2009), at the <a href="https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" target="_blank">Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)</a> for the development of a software tool for lidar optimization in near field, 
based on paraxial approximation. 
During 2010-2011 I was awarded with a Networking / Partnering Initiative (NPI) program from <a href="http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC" target="_blank">European Space Agency (ESA-ESTEC)</a>. 
After my Ph.D. and for the time period 2014-2017 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.astro.noa.gr/en/main/" target="_blank"> National Observatory of Athens (NOA-ISSARS)</a> 
in the framework of ESA<a>&apos;</a>s <a href="http://environment.inoe.ro/category/79/multiply" target="_blank">MULTIPLY</a> project on the development of the first European HSRL airborne facility. 
In October 2017, I moved to <a href="http://kuwebcont.ku.edu.kw/physc/People/FacultyMembers/" target="_blank">Kuwait University</a> as Assistant Professor and I joined the Remote Sensing Group in the Department of Physics. 
<p></p>
I like programming, especially developing user friendly software packages for depolarization and Raman lidar signal analysis. 
I worked also on lidar simulation/development, through Zemax optical design code. My computer skills include a very good knowledge of programming languages (Matlab, Zemax, Lascad, Mathematica, ITT IDL, LabVIEW, C, Java, Python, etc.).
<p></p>
I have participated in 14 research projects and in 14 experimental campaigns (11 European and 3 National). 
I have 39 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and more than 40 publications in conference proceedings, various scientific and technical reports. 
I was member of the conference organization committee of the 26<sup>th</sup> International Laser Radar Conference (2012), and co-editor of the proceedings. 
Finally I am an active reviewer in 14 scientific Journals, acknowledged with outstanding reviewer award for the two consecutive years 2018 and 2019, 
and guest editor of one special issue.
