     I was born in 1981, in Greece. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences 
    (field of optoelectronics and laser) and my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Physics from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece in 2007, 2009 and 2014, respectively. 
     As an undergraduate and graduate research assistant at NTUA I worked in the field of ground based and space borne active and passive remote sensing techniques. 
     My Ph.D. thesis was mainly focused on a technical part related with the upgrade/optimization of NTUA’s Raman lidar, as well as on the atmospheric aerosol characterization (optical and microphysical properties) 
     through the synergy of Raman/depolarization lidar and sunphotometric techniques. During the implementation of my Ph.D., I worked for 3 months (2009), at the Ludwig Maximilians University for the development 
     of a software tool for lidar optimization in near field, based on paraxial approximation. In addition, I developed several user friendly software packages for depolarization and Raman lidar signal analysis at NTUA. 
     I worked also on lidar simulation/development, through Zemax optical design code. My computer skills include a very good knowledge of programming languages (Matlab, Zemax, Lascad, Mathematica, ITT IDL, LabVIEW, C, Java, Python, etc.).
