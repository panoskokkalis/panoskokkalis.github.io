Born in Greece in 1981, I received my B.Sc. (2007) and M.Sc. (2009) from the department of <a href="http://www.semfe.ntua.gr/en/" target="_blank">Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences</a> (major in optoelectronics and laser technology), 
of the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/" target="_blank">National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)</a>. 
In 2014, I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="http://lrsu.physics.ntua.gr/" target="_blank">Atmospheric Physics and Remote Sensing</a> at NTUA.
<p>     </p>
<p>     </p>
My Ph.D. thesis was focused on upgrading and optimizing NTUA's Raman lidar system and characterizing atmospheric aerosols (optical and microphysical properties) through the synergy of Raman/depolarization lidar and sunphotometric measurements. 
During that period, I had three months (2009) at <a href="https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" target="_blank">Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)</a>, developing a software tool for lidar optimization in the near field using paraxial approximation. 
For the next two years (2010<a>&ndash;</a>2012), I worked for the <a href="http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC" target="_blank">European Space Agency (ESA-ESTEC)</a>, under a Networking/Partnering Initiative (NPI) grant. 
<p>     </p>
<p>     </p>
As a postdoctoral researcher (2014<a>&ndash;</a>2017) at the <a href="https://www.astro.noa.gr/en/main/" target="_blank">National Observatory of Athens (NOA-ISSARS)</a>, 
I contributed to ESA<a>&apos;</a>s <a href="http://environment.inoe.ro/category/79/multiply" target="_blank">MULTIPLY</a> project, 
which aimed to develop Europe<a>&apos;</a>s first HSRL airborne facility for atmospheric research. 
<p>     </p>
<p>     </p>
In October 2017, I joined <a href="https://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/physc/People/FacultyMembers/" target="_blank">Kuwait University (KU)</a> as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics (Space & Climate Physics group). In May 2023, I was promoted to Associate Professor. 
During my tenure at KU, I have lectured core Physics courses as well as higher level courses related to climate and remote sensing. 
Additionally, I contribute to the development of a minor in science and graduate courses in aerosol remote sensing. Finally, I am actively involved in various departmental committees.  
<p>     </p>
<p>     </p>
I have a strong interest in ground-based and spaceborne active and passive remote sensing techniques, for atmospheric monitoring and climate change. 
My computer skills encompass several programming languages (i.e. Matlab, Zemax, Lascad, Mathematica, ITT IDL, LabVIEW, C, Java, Python, QGIS, ERDAS, ArcGIS).
<p>     </p>
<p>     </p>
Throughout my career, I have participated in 18 research projects and 14 experimental campaigns (11 European and 3 National). 
I have authored <a href="https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=-fgHT94AAAAJ&hl=eng" target="_blank">50 publications</a> in peer-reviewed scientific journals and over 50 publications in conference proceedings, scientific and technical reports. I served on the organizing committee for the 26<sup>th</sup> International Laser Radar Conference (2012) and co-edited the proceedings. 
Additionally, I am an active reviewer for over 15 scientific journals, having received outstanding reviewer awards (2018 and 2019), 
and have been a guest editor for two special issues.
