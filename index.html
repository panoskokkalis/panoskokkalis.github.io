I was born in 1981, in Greece. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences (field of optoelectronics and laser) from the 
National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece in 2007 and 2009 respectively. I defended my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Physics/Remote Sensing from NTUA in 2014. 
As an undergraduate and graduate research assistant I worked in the field of ground based and space borne active and passive remote sensing techniques. 
My Ph.D. thesis was mainly focused on a technical part related with the upgrade/optimization of NTUA<a>&apos;</a>s Raman lidar, as well as on the atmospheric aerosol characterization (optical and microphysical properties) through the synergy of Raman/depolarization lidar and sunphotometric techniques. 
During the implementation of my Ph.D., I worked for 3 months (2009), at the Ludwig Maximilians University for the development of a software tool for lidar optimization in near field, based on paraxial approximation. 
During 2010-2011 I was awarded with a Networking / Partnering Initiative (NPI) program from European Space Agency (ESA-ESTEC). After my Ph.D. and for the time period 2014-2017 
I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at National Technical Observatory of Athens (NOA-ISSARS) in the framework of ESA<a>&apos;</a>s MULTIPLY project on the development of the first European HSRL airborne facility. 
In October 2017, I moved to Kuwait University as Assistant Professor and I joined the Remote Sensing Group in the Department of Physics. 
<p></p>
I like programming, especially developing user friendly software packages for depolarization and Raman lidar signal analysis. 
I worked also on lidar simulation/development, through Zemax optical design code. My computer skills include a very good knowledge of programming languages (Matlab, Zemax, Lascad, Mathematica, ITT IDL, LabVIEW, C, Java, Python, etc.).
<p></p>
I have participated in 14 research projects and in 14 experimental campaigns (11 European and 3 national). 
I have 25 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and more than 40 publications in conference proceedings, various scientific and technical reports. 
I was member of the conference organization committee of the 26th International Laser Radar Conference (2012), and co-editor of the proceedings. 
Finally I am an active reviewer in 5 scientific Journals.
